# Cathy-python
Cross-platform python implementation of Robert Vasicek's Win-only popular Cathy disk catalog tool. Mainly focussed on providing osx and linux support, since the original already works for Windows. No GUI, mainly intended for simple cli search of existing .caf files and also automatic scanning of (backup) disks.
